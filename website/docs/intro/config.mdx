The app use a config file written in YAML to describe the actual state of your stock portfolio. For each stock in the list, you must report some informations:
- The name (you can choose a custom name if your want)
- The Yahoo! finance stock symbol
- The purchased quantity
- The fees when you bought the share(s)
- The unit price when you bought the share(s)
- The number of owned shares (different from the purchased_quantity if you got some frees)
- The dividends you received

:::caution
The config file has to be named **config.yaml**. To see where it should be located on your filesystem, read the [deployment section](/docs/category/deployment)

## Use Case

I own some shares, that I want to monitor : 
* 2 shares of Apple stock (bought one, got the second free)
* 3 shares of Tesla stocks (bought not in the same time)

Here's the corresponding config file: 

```yaml title="config.yaml"
shares:
- name: Apple
  symbol: AAPL # Yahoo! finance stock symbol
  purchase:
    quantity: 1
    fee: 2 # Fees when I bought the share 
    cost_price: 119.98  # Value of the share when I bought it 
  estate:
    quantity: 2 # Because, I got one free
    received_dividend: 2.85 # Sum of all received dividend
- name: Tesla
  symbol: TLSA
  purchase:
    quantity: 3
    fee: 5.8 # When buying multiple shares, sum of fees
    cost_price: 856.87  # When buying multiple shares with different price, weighted average
  estate:
    quantity: 3
    received_dividend: 4.57
```
