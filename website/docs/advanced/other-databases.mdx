In the case of you don't want to store the data in Prometheus, you can use [Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.23/) to export the data exposed by the app to others system like:
- ElasticSearch
- InfluxDB (v1 or v2)
- MongoDB

## Telegraf Input Config Example

```toml
# Read metrics from suivi bourse app
[[inputs.prometheus]]
  ## An array of urls to scrape metrics from.
  urls = ["http://localhost:8100/metrics"]
  
  ## Metric version controls the mapping from Prometheus metrics into Telegraf metrics.
  ## See "Metric Format Configuration" in plugins/inputs/prometheus/README.md for details.
  ## Valid options: 1, 2
  metric_version = 1
  
  ## Url tag name (tag containing scrapped url. optional, default is "url")
  url_tag = "suivi-bourse"
```
